In making this game I first wanted to get all my ideas on paper.  Or should I say on webpage.  I first started with making a website.  I sketched it out and then typed out every item (html).  Next I went into the website design(css).  After that I went into 
making the actual game.  When making the game I followed two main tutorials.  The first
was my IGME 235 class's circle blast.  This helped me lay out the very basic structure of it all and how to move items.  Next to reinforce all of this I followed Dr. Dower Chin's
Pixi js YouTube series to further my knowledge of pixi.  Once the basics were done I went
into the more detailed portions of the game.  Everything went very smoothly besides the original sprites.  When I first started making this game my sprites were not loading
correctly.  To fix this I had to re-arrange when I loaded and called certain sprites.  Another issue I ran into was learning just how JavaScript classes connected and interacted
with each other.  Once I figured that out, which did not take too long due to the similarities from c#, I was golden.  One of my most favorite features in my game was the numerous enemies.  There are currently four ways for enemies to attack you.  A normal shot, double shot, triple shot and then a boss fight.  I take great pride in this because I used everything I have learned thus far in my career to properly make this and I am very very happy with it.
